# Secure Password Form

![Create Password Form](./form-image.png)

This project is a recreation of a user-friendly, modern, and intuitive password creation form, originally inspired by a LinkedIn post from [Memorizely](https://www.linkedin.com/school/memorisely/) and [Zander Whitehurst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zanderwhitehurst/). The goal was to replicate the design using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, challenging myself to see if I still had a solid understanding of the browser API and the DOM.
